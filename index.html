                Welcome to Fashion’s New World!
                <br/>Why Everything’s Changing—And Who’s Behind It
            </p>

                There was a moment, midway through the Balenciaga show at the New 
                York Stock Exchange in May, when the venue’s countless stock-ticker 
                displays began to freak out, screens flashing and pixelating in time with 
                the techno soundtrack as latex-masked models clad in satirically large 
                business suits stomped by, never breaking stride. <b><cite>Aha</cite></b>, I thought: <b><cite>Yes, truly 
                we are living in the extended-dance-remix era of late capitalism.</b></cite>
                Everything’s breaking down—global pandemic, culture war, actual war,
                climate crisis, inflation, what even is crypto, anyway?—but the song keeps
                playing on its endless loop, and so we keep dancing to its beat.

            Just Jouez! Jacquemus x Nike Sensual Sportswear Has Just Been Restocked—Shop it Now
        </p>
        <p class="Therewasamoment">
            Simon Porte Jacquemus’s shows in Hawaii, Provence, and Paris have
            included sport-centric pieces like scuba gear, hiking boots, and swimwear, 
            but when his models walk the Paris runways in late June, they will be 
            playing a whole new game, so to speak: Nearly three years in the making,
            Jacquemus’s debut collaboration with Nike marries the designer’s love of 
            the outdoors and his body-​conscious aesthetic with Nike’s expertise in 
            making some of the most technically advanced activewear in the world.

            The Best Street Style Photos From the Fall 2023 Menswear Season at Pitti Uomo
        </p>
        <p class="Therewasamoment">
            The sun is out in Florence and the city is full of editors, stylists, and buyers, 
            in town for the Pitti Uomo fair and its headliner, guest designer Martine 
            Rose. Pitti always brings a mix of different styles, from traditional suiting to 
            edgier streetwear pieces. Hats are key, no matter the uniform, as are a 
            fashionable set of shades. Scroll through the best street-style photos from
            this season’s Pitti Uomo fair here, as photographed by Acielle Tanbetova.
